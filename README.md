Welcome to Hack Your Future Belgium. There are a lot of code, links, and browser
tabs in your near future!

It'll take a little while to learn how to keep this all organized in your head
and on your computer. If you're having trouble finding something, take a look
through the links in your class repository. If you still can't find it, ask your
classmates on Discord and someone will help you out!

This module's main objective is to get you comfortable with the workflows of
programming and Hack Your Future BE. The finished projects won't be complex
or impressive to an outsider, but to complete them you will need to have a basic
overview of the entire development process. Including: ideation, local
development, pushing and pulling to github, and hosting static web pages.

## Learning Objectives

<details>
<summary>Priorities: 🥚, 🐣, 🐥, 🐔 (click to learn more)</summary>
<br>

There is a lot to learn in this module. If you can't master all the material at
once, that's expected! Anything you don't master now will always be waiting for
you to review when you need it. These 4 emoji's will help you prioritize your
study time and to measure your progress:

- 🥚: Understanding this material is required, it covers the base skills you'll
  need for this module and the next. You do not need to finish all of them but
  should feel comfortable that you could with enough time.
- 🐣: You have started all of these exercises and feel you could complete them
  all if you just had more time. It may not be easy for you but with effort, you can make it through.
- 🐥: You have studied the examples and started some exercises if you had time.
  You should have a big-picture understanding of these concepts/skills, but may
  not be confident completing the exercises.
- 🐔: These concepts or skills are not necessary but are related to this module.
  If you are finished with 🥚, 🐣 and 🐥 you can use the 🐔 exercises to push
  yourself without getting distracted from the module's main objectives.
